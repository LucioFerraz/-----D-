## Resume:
Project developed to analyze the impact of Erasmus+ students (so-called Erasmus Generation) in creating a pan-European identity.


## Tools:
 - Python, Jupyter Notebook, Panda, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplot and Tableau.


## Data Source:
- https://data.europa.eu


## Data Processing:

The data in csv format were downloaded and processed in jupyter terminal, where libraries were imported and Python commands were applied for data cleaning and treatment, creation of DataFrame and other commands that allowed for an exploratory analysis of the data, which allowed to know them in depth, to later do the Data Visualization with Tableau tool.

## Data Visualization:

For a overview of data it was used Tableau as tool for Data Visualization.

- The participants numbers in Erasmus+ programme increase over year, which is why the programme under reformulation and the budget, projects and partner countries increase:

- The participants by gender is a majority female,  however, the men participants also increased. An interesting point to highlight is that participants who declared themselves undefinide also increase, which demonstrates greater tolerance and respect by educational institutions and society:

- The special needs participants has fluctuated up and down when compared to previous years, however, in global numbers the number of participants has increased:

- Top 10 most popular countries for mobility. Spain is the European country that receives the most students, followed by Germany and France. Regarding the countries that send the most, the three follow in the ranking, however with change, with Germany being the country that sends the most students to Erasmus+, followed by France and Spain:

## Conclusions: 
The assumption is that young Europeans, who enjoyed the benefits of Erasmus+ Programme, think of themselves as European citizens, and therefore create a base of support for further European integration. The program has been fulfilling its goals of greater equity, equality, access to education and opportunities, increasing the annual budget, number of projects and partner countries and through the erasmus generation the future holds a greater europe unity, integration and pan-European identity. Some academics have speculated that former Erasmus students will prove to be a powerful force in creating a pan-European identity and some political scientist, for example, has argued that in 20 or 25 years, and Europe will be run by leaders with a completely different socialization from those of today", referring to the so-called 'Erasmus generation' .
