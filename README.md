## Resume
Project developed to analyze the impact of Erasmus+ students (so-called Erasmus Generation) in creating a pan-European identity.


## tools
 - Python, Jupyter Notebook, Panda, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplot and Tableau.


## data source
- https://data.europa.eu


## data processing

The data in csv format were downloaded and processed in the jupyter terminal, where libraries were imported and Python commands were applied for data cleaning and treatment, creation of DataFrame and other commands that allowed for an exploratory analysis of the data, which allowed to know them in depth, to later do the Data Visualization with Tableau tool. https://github.com/LucioFerraz/PanEuropean-Identity-ErasmusProgramme/tree/main/Jupyter%20Code


## analysis

For a overview of data it was used Tableau as tool for Data Visualization. https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucio.ferraz/viz/--D/--D

- The participants by gender is a majority female,  however, the men participants also increased. An interesting point to highlight is that participants who declared themselves undefinide also increase, which demonstrates greater tolerance and respect by educational institutions and society:

## issues
Some songs and artists searched through the code were not found, leaving some data incomplete.


## future resolutions
Improve code to get more data in spotify-api.
